 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 
In my prototype, I build an open environment with a FPS view. The goal of this game is to use the platforms and obstacles to climb up to the Green platform. Using bullets, you can destroy some platforms, but destroying too many will leave you unable to reach the goal! This game had a big focus on evoking the emotion of frustration as you try to climb and keep falling.
